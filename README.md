## How program works

0. evaluate if expresisons is valid
1. convert string into tree
2. print tree to consol
3. for calculation:
      give string to pythons eval() function
4. save tree in json file
5. to reload import tree from json file (can be calculated and printed)
6. unittest of program

## Roadmap



- write unittest for tree conversion

## Finsihed

~~- validate expression (look into pythons eval function)
    use regex to convet input string into only brackets
    use stack to match brackets
    has to say what is wrong with expression if it is wrong~~

~~- calulate the answer from the expression~~

~~- convert an expresison into a tree
    maybe with a stack~~

~~- saving and loading a tree to/from .txt~~

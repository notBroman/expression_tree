## How program works

0. evaluate if expresisons is valid
1. convert string into tree
2. print tree to consol
3. for calculation:
      cast nodes as Expr and use the overloaded operators
4. save tree in json file
5. to reload import tree from json file (can be calculated and printed)


## Roadmap

- convert an expresison into a tree
    maybe with regex
- validate expression (look into pythons eval function)
    use regex to convet input string into only brackets
    use stack to match brackets
- saving and loading a tree to/from json
